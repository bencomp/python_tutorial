Variables always need to be given a name. This name can be used to retrieve the 'contents' of the variable. These contents (the data referred to by the variable) are also referred to as the variable's *value*. \n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned, variables can be given a value. The act of giving a value to a certain variable is called *assignment*. In the first example, the variable named place_name is assigned the value ‘Leiden’. The second example captures a number."
